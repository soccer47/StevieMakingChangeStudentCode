| Jan 23 | 4:30pm-5:15pm | I spent a long time thinking through the problem set and possible approaches I could take to solve it. I've decided that for my first attempt I'll try to use BFS to get all the possible combinations, and store each combination in a HashMap, using the numbers of each coin as a key and adding a filler boolean as a value. I will use an array of length [# of coins] to represent the number of each coin in a given combination. Using a HashMap will also prevent duplicate entries of the same combination because when you try to add a duplicate entry only the latest entry is kept. |

I spent a lot of time thinking through and then creating the BFS method, and then I filled in the main method accordingly. I just tried running my code, however I got an index out of bounds error. |

After fixing that I went on to fix a few more bugs that popped up. Now when I try to run my code it takes super long for the larger test cases (as in it just keeps going and going and would have probably gone on for many more minutes), and for the smallest test case I am returning one too few possibilities. |

I made a few edits in an attempt to make my code a bit faster, however I wasn't able to figure out why I'm not returning the right number/undercounting for the smallest test case. |

We tried to come up with ways to avoid repeated paths and also minimize space consumption with our ideas, however by the end of class we hadn't come up with an efficient way to solve the problem set. A lot of our ideas were centered around trying to store the paths in arrays of length # coin or possible hash the values in the path. |
